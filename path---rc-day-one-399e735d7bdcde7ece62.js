Here’s a little look back at Day 1.</p>\n<p>Wow, the first day was so exciting and so exhausting. Unlike any other day at RC, the yesterday was packed with activities. We spent a lot of time meeting people, finding out what people were working on, and pairing on a sample project. There’s a ton of great energy here, and a little of angst, which is just perfect.</p>\n<p>One of my favorite things about RC so far is the overlapping sessions, called “batches.” We are able to ask advice of people who are already half way through their time here, and pick up traditions and ideas that might otherwise be lost. The RC staff are intentionally hands-off and have written extensively about how this attitude comes out of experiments geared towards fostering independent learning and positive culture. This means that the overlapping batches are a great way to find out about systems you might be interested in perpetuating, like study groups, check-ins, abstract salad lunches, and project ideas.</p>",frontmatter:{title:"The First Day at RC",date:"September 26, 2017"}}},pathContext:{path:"/rc-day-one/"}}}});
