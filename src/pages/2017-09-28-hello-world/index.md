Hi! I'm testing my new blog. It's basically still the template, so thank you [Kyle Mathews](https://twitter.com/kylemathews) for posting this Gatsby starter blog on [GitHub](https://github.com/gatsbyjs/gatsby-starter-blog) and documenting the GitHub Pages [set up](https://www.gatsbyjs.org/docs/deploy-gatsby/#github-pages). I'm excited to learn enough React to be able to customize it a bit more. Cheers to writing!
